\section{Console API}
\textbf{Availabe:} always

~\\
The text console is a character-based bidirectional interface exposed on the controller board. Transmit and receive (TX and RX) queues are present on the chip and operate autonomously.
The API exposes a simple string-based transmit option as well as both a blocking and non-blocking single-character API for both TX and RX. Task-level blocking is implemented for receive events.

~\\
\textit{Implementation details:} characters are transmitted in 8N1 mode at 9600 baud. In the future, this may be configurable.

\subsection{\texttt{.console}}

\subsection{\texttt{.console.tx}}
\textbf{Valid for:} write

~\\
\textit{Write}

Write a single ASCII character to the text console. If TX blocking is enabled, wait until the character is added to the TX queue before returning ``true''.
If TX blocking is disabled, return ``true'' if the character was added to the TX queue and ``false'' otherwise.

\subsection{\texttt{.console.tx.ready}}
\textbf{Valid for:} read

~\\

\subsection{\texttt{.console.rx}}
\textbf{Valid for:} read

\section{Timer API}
\textbf{Available:} always

~\\
Timers are implemented as monotonic counters with a configurable prescaler and period. Once the period is reached, the timer expires and automatically resumes counting from zero.

~\\

pair is currently selected.

\section{Generic I\textsuperscript{2}C API}
\textbf{Available:} with any compatible daughter

~\\
An I\textsuperscript{2}C interface is broken out on dedicated pins on the controller board, meaning it is available to any daughter, including ad-hoc ones. If a application-specific API exists, it will often be preferable to this one.

Briefly, I\textsuperscript{2}C is a two-wire interface supporting multiple-master, multiple-slave configurations. It is capable of robust bus sharing including collision detection. Care must be taken to insure that no two slaves have the same address on the bus -- most slaves, however, support multiple address configurations.

~\\
\textit{Hardware note:} per specifications, the total capacitance on the bus must not exceed 400pF. The maximum pull-up resistance also decreases as the capacitance increases. Practically, this means that the allowable length of the bus decreases as more slaves are added.

~\\
\textit{implementation pending}

\section{NeoPixel API}
\textbf{Available:} when attached to one or more NeoPixels

~\\
Adafruit NeoPixels are small 24-bit color LEDs that can be chained together and programmed individually.

The NeoPixels are controlled over a 1-wire self-clocking protocol which can be derived from multiple sources in the control. The API exposes both a fast, SPI-backed interface as well as a slower, software interface.
Up to two hardware mode chains can be driven (assuming no other API is using the SPI modules) as well as any number of software chains, limited only by the number of outputs available. In the reference below,
the abbreviation ``hwX'' is used to represent one of two hardware chains: ``hw0'' or ``hw1.''

~\\
\textit{Implementation note:} memory for two chains that share a pool of 200 NeoPixels are available for the hardware interface. The software interface does not have a dedicated chain, and
may not need one to operate, depending on desired behavior, but can also soft-multiplex the 200 NeoPixels into any desired combination.

~\\
\textit{Hardware note:} NeoPixels should never be powered directly from the output pins, and care should be taken when powering them off of the controller's supply.
Additionally, if they are powered at above approx.~3.5v, level shifting will be required on the controller outputs.

\section{System API}
\textbf{Available:} always

~\\
A number of system features are grouped into this API, and many more will be in the future. Currently, it includes access to the CPU's Count register and control of the controller board's status LED.

~\\
\textit{Implementation details:} the rate at which the Count register increases is based on the core, not the peripheral, clock and thus will vary depending on the CPU clock speed.
Currently, the CPU clock is fixed at 40Mhz, but this may change in the future.

\subsection{\texttt{.system.delay}}

\subsection{\texttt{.system.led}}
\textbf{Valid for:} read, write

~\\
\textit{Read}

Returns the state of the user status LED (the green component of the general status LED) as a numeric value: either 0, indicating ``off'', or 1 (the default), indicating ``on''.

~\\
\textit{Write}

Sets the state of the user status LED based on a numeric value: either 0, indicating ``turn off'', or 1, indicating ``turn on''. Always returns ``true''.

\subsection{\texttt{.system.tick}}
\textbf{Valid for:} read, write

~\\
\textit{Read}

Returns the current system tick. The tick increases monotonically every 50ns whether or not any tasks are running, even during delays triggered by writing to \texttt{.system.delay}. The tick starts at zero and will roll over to $-2^{31}$ after reaching $+2^{32}-1$.

~\\
\textit{Write}

Sets the current system tick to a new value, from which point it will continue to increase as usual every 50ns.

\section{Task API}

\subsection{\texttt{.task.size}}
\textbf{Valid for:} read, write

\textit{read}

Returns the scheduling ``depth'' of the current task.

Body:

1.) What is the sequence of commands passed to the bootloader to program an image?

    Once a serial connection is established (by default: /dev/ttyUSB0 9600 8N1),
    the following communication occurs:

        Step 1:
            image loader sends '>'
            bootloader replies with either:
                '>' -- proceed to step 2 or 3
                'm' -- read a newline-terminated message from the bootloader and
                       repeat step 1

        Step 2 (optional):
            image loader sends 'V'
            bootloader replies with 8-byte version string
            if the response matches the internal version:
                proceed to step 2
            otherwise,
                exit indicating failure

        Step 3:
            image loader sends 'L'
            proceed to step 4
        
        Step 4:
            if the bootloader replies with 'OK':
                send a 2-byte block size, followed by 1024 bytes of image data
                if there is image data left to send:
                    repeat step 4
                otherwise:
                    proceed to step 5
            if the bootloader replies with 'mi':
                read a newline-terminated information message from the bootloader
                repeat step 4
            if the bootloader replies with 'me':
                read a newline-terminated error message from the bootloader
                repeat step 4
            if the bootloader replies with 'no':
                exit indicating failure

        Step 5:
            if the bootloader replies with 'OK ':
                proceed to step 6
            if the bootloader replies with 'CRC':
                read a 4-byte integer and compare it with the calculated CRC
                if they match:
                    proceed to step 6
                otherwise,
                    exit indicating failure
            if the bootloader replies with 'ERR':
                read a newline-terminated error message from the bootloader
                exit indicating failure

        Step 6 (optional):
            image loader sends 'F' then 'h' to disable soft hold
            bootloader replies with 'h'

        Step 7:
            image loader sends 'R'
            if the bootloader replies with 'R':
                exit indicating success
            otherwise,
                exit indicating failure

2.) What other commands does the bootloader support?

    Interaction with the bootloader's flags is performed with the 'F' command.
    See doc/bootloader/flags for more information.

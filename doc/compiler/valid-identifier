1.) What identifiers are considered valid for variable and function names?

    Identifiers are composed of a sequence of alphanumeric and underscore
    characters with the following rules:
        An identifier must have at least one alphabetic character [a-zA-Z]
        An identifier must not begin with a digit [0-9]
        An identifier must not begin with more than two underscores

Body:

1.) What identifiers are considered valid for variable and function names?

    Identifiers are composed of a sequence of alphanumeric, underscore,
    and period characters with the following rules:
        An identifier must have at least one alphabetic character [a-zA-Z]
        An identifier must not begin with a period or a digit [.0-9]
        An identifier must not begin with more than two underscores
